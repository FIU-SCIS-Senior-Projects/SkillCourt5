So there are two folders here, New Version and Old Version. You want to use "New Version" only. The other one is for previous versions of this project but we rebuilt it from the ground up because the previous versions were made in Processing, a programming language made more for engineers and had NO comments so it was a nightmare to try and understand and our product owner wanted it completely in Java, we also have a version with a remote DB in there but you need to implement it with the remote DB. In "New Version", you will find two folders, SkillCourt5 and SkillCourt5Arduino. SkillCourt5 you just need to load it in Netbeans, Eclipse, InteliJ, whatever IDE you want. SkillCourt5Arduino NEEDS the Arduino IDE. In that folder you find a .ino file that needs to be uploaded to the Arduinos before you can run it. You only need to upload it once or every time you edit the .ino code. You will need to add a JAR file called rxtxComm to your library and change you classpath which is explained in howto video. Good Luck!
